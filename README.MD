Front end big module of the project 

Bureaucracy Hacks* Intermediate - Advanced Create an application that makes it easy to find information regarding various Romanian governmental institutions. The application’s main functionality will be the ease of figuring out what documents are required for various tasks and processes. For example the list of documents and taxes needed to issue a police record.

The application should also contain accurate information regarding the operating hours of the institution. Users should be able to add their experienced waiting time using that to calculate an average waiting time so that other users can make a more informed decision when going to an institution.

The other critical functionality for the application would be to analyze the document requirements for a certain bureaucratic process and identify where a user can get it.

Using google maps, when a user selects a certain task they have to get done, the application creates a route for them to take to various institutions or copy centers in order to acquire all necessary documents, using the estimated wait time, a user can estimate the amount of time it will take to finish everything or if they can only partially complete the task. For example: A user selects that he desires to issue a police record, the application will identify that the user needs to create a photocopy of their ID, buy 2 stamps from a post office, fill out a request form and bring their original ID. From this the application will find the fastest route that includes a post office, copy center, and police station, it will also warn the user that he is required to have his ID on him, and that he would need to pay a total of 40 RON, and that the algorithm estimates the process will take a total of 2 hours.

Users should also be able to comment on various tasks/processes/institutions such that they can warn other users of mistakes in the information presented in the application, gather feedback to then forward the institution’s management, or share certain useful information such as closest parking spots. The POC is accepted to be designed only for the city of Iasi.
